I have created a soccer game using just JavaScript
This simple FIFA-style soccer game includes:

Game Features:
Soccer field with goals, penalty areas, and center circle
Player movement using WASD keys
Ball physics with momentum and friction
Player-controlled character (red team)
Basic AI opponents (blue team)
Goal detection and scoring system
Reset functionality (R key)
Controls:
W, A, S, D: Move your player
SPACE: Kick the ball when in possession
R: Reset ball position
Game Elements:
Realistic soccer field with markings
Score tracking for both teams
Goal celebration messages
Ball possession mechanics
Simple AI that follows the ball
How to Play:
Click "Start Game" to begin
Control your player (red) with WASD keys
Get close to the ball to possess it
Press SPACE to kick in the direction you're moving
Score by kicking the ball into the opponent's goal
The game is designed to be simple yet fun with basic physics and AI. The field has visual details like grass texture lines and proper soccer field markings. You can reset the ball position with the R key if it gets stuck.
